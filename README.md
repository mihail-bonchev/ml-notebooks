# m1-notebooks

This repository is my personal playground for learning deep learning from scratch. All experiments start with minimal dependencies (NumPy only) and focus on understanding the fundamentals of neural networks, gradient descent, and backpropagation.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains all learning notebooks.
- `01_single_neuron.ipynb`: First notebook implementing a single neuron from scratch.

## Goals

- Build intuition for how neural networks learn.
- Understand forward and backward passes manually.
- Gradually scale up from a single neuron to multi-layer networks and eventually simple architectures.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10+.
3. Install NumPy:

```bash
pip install numpy
